BloGo is a blog system in Go. With support for developers.

# Getting started

You should have a go compiler and MongoDB in your system, then:

```sh
make run
```

# Developers and contributors

The process is being documented in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPMVwd1js0I&list=PLMPsqnO6mKSDaL1nX3gzUP43HXJtIl4xJ.


# Editing frontend

Frontend files are embedded in the binary, so `make statics` will do the trick.
